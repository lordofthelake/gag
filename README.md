# Gag

Gag allows you to split your Gulpfile in multiple modules and allow extensions to pitch in to extend existing tasks.

## Installation

```
npm install --save gag
```

## Usage

Each module has its own `Gagfile.js`, that collects tasks and combines dependencies. They can then be pulled in from the module that needs building in its `Gulpfile` and invoked through the usual `gulp` CLI semantics.

It also gives submodules a simplified access to main module's `package.json` `config` section and to the command line parameters, that get merged in a single object for ease of access and overriding.

###Â Gagfile.js

#### Namespaced tasks
```javascript
var Gag = require('gag');

module.exports = new Gag(module, function (gulp, config) {
  gulp.task('js', function () {
    // ...
  });
});

```

#### Extending tasks

```javascript
var Gag = require('gag');

module.exports = new Gag(module, function (gulp, config) {
  gulp.extend('js', new Gag.Pipeline()
    .before(somePlugin)
    .after(someOtherPlugin)
  );

});

```

### Gulpfile.js

```javascript
var Gag  = require('gag');
var gulp = require('gulp');

new Gag(module)
    .weave('moduleA/Gagfile.js')
    .weave('moduleB/Gagfile.js')
    .pour(gulp);
```
